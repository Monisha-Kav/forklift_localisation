#  # If your coordinate frame is defined as: +X = East (E), +Y = North (N)
#  # Then your angles (θ, or yaw) follow standard mathematical (ROS) convention:
#  # θ = 0 → Facing East (positive X)
#  # θ = +π/2 → Facing North (positive Y)
#  # θ = ±π → Facing West (negative X)
# #  # θ = -π/2 → Facing South (negative Y)
